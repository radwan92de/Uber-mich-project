What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This extension integrates the jQuery-library from CDN with a local fallback if requested library is not available. All relevant versions of jQuery (including minified and gzipped-versions) are shipped with this extension.
The script is automatically added on top of your included javascript and loads the latest jquery-library per default.
