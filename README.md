## The main steps are:
1. create the template by HTML5, CSS3 and Jquery.
2. the template is created according to the @media screen (support pc and mobile views). 
3. integrate the template (especially the HTML5 parts) into TYPO3.
4. include the reuired extentions (note: I edit @grid-float-breakpoint to sm).
5. Make the main template parts (profile picture and name, skills, about, contact) dynamic by creating Backend Layout.
6. I have tested the display with different browsers (by using browserstack) and it works fine.

### Looking for your comments about that!

Have a good time,
